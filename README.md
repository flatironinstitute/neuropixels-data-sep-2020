# neuropixels-data-sep-2020
Example electrophysiology recordings for the purpose of developing and optimizing spike sorting algorithms for neuropixels probes. Methods for dealing with drift are of particular interest.

## Overview

This repository contains links to some ephys recordings using neuropixels probes together with curated spike sorting results. It also contains two recordings with known imposed drift and two hybrid pseudo-ground truth neuropixels recordings. These may be used to evaluate the performance of spike sorting methods.

You can interact with the data in various ways:

* Visualize data within the web browser (links below)
* Load data directly into Python [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface) objects (more information below)
* Download files from their original source (where available in links below)

## Datasets

The following recordings were generated using [prepare_datasets.py](./scripts/prepare_datasets/prepare_datasets.py).

**NOTE**:

The recording/sorting exploration tool in the web links below is under active
development, with particular attention to adding new visualizations and improving
performance. Users may experience load times of several seconds in some cases.
Thank you for your patience.

## Loading into **Python** and exporting to various formats

Because electrophysiology recordings can be large, we have created a peer-to-peer sharing system ([kachery-p2p](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/kachery-p2p)) that runs in Linux or Mac and interfaces directly to Python. By running a kachery-p2p daemon on your computer, you are participating in the network for sharing these datasets with other users of the system.

We have integrated this system with [SpikeInterface](https://github.com/SpikeInterface) which allows lazy loading of recordings into RecordingExtractor objects.

**Step 1.** You must be running a kachery-p2p daemon on the `flatiron1` channel.
[See these instructions](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/kachery-p2p).
The kachery-p2p tool has been tested on Linux and MacOS.

**Step 2.** Clone and pip-install this repo in development mode (you should use a virtualenv or conda environment):

```
git clone https://github.com/flatironinstitute/neuropixels-data-sep-2020
cd neuropixels-data-sep-2020
pip install -e .
```

For subsequent updates, run `git pull` and rerun the `pip install -e .`

**Step 3.** Load a recording into a SpikeInterface recording extractor:

```python
import neuropixels_data_sep_2020 as nd
import spikeextractors as se

# Replace this with the desired recording ID from above
recording_id = 'cortexlab-single-phase-3 (ch 0-7, 10 sec)'

# Note: if the files are not already on your, then you need
# to run a kachery-p2p daemon on the flatiron1 channel.
recording = nd.load_recording(recording_id)

# recording is a SpikeInterface recording extractor
# so you can extract information
samplerate = recording.get_sampling_frequency()
num_frames = recording.get_num_frames()
num_channels = len(recording.get_channel_ids())
channel_locations = recording.get_channel_locations()

print(f'Num. channels: {num_channels}')
print(f'Duration: {num_frames / samplerate} sec')

# You can also extract the raw traces.
# This will only download the part of the raw file needed
traces = recording.get_traces(channel_ids=[0, 1, 2, 3], start_frame=0, end_frame=5000)
print(f'Shape of extracted traces: {traces.shape}')

# Or equivalently (using SubRecordingExtractor):
recording_sub = se.SubRecordingExtractor(
    parent_recording=recording,
    channel_ids=[0, 1, 2, 3],
    start_frame=0, end_frame=5000
)
traces2 = recording_sub.get_traces()
print(f'Shape of extracted traces: {traces2.shape}')
```

Once a dataset is loaded into a SpikeInterface extractor, you can
interact with it directly in Python. The data will be
lazy-loaded from the peer-to-peer network.

You can create subextractors as above, and export to any of the
[formats supported by SpikeExtractors](https://github.com/SpikeInterface/spikeextractors/tree/master/spikeextractors/extractors).

```python
import spikeextractors as se

# Example export to raw binary .dat
se.BinDatRecordingExtractor.write_recording(recording, '/output/file.dat')
```

## Downloading the data for use in **MATLAB or other languages**

If you plan to do your analysis in python we recommend you use spikeextractors as a container for passing data around as illustrated above. If not, or for other reasons, you can download the data directly to disk using a `download_all.py` script (in progress).

Single Phase 3 dataset source data: http://data.cortexlab.net/singlePhase3

## Data from Josh Siegle

Notes about the Allen Institute curated sorting output:

Units were selected based on the following criteria:
```
ISI violations < 0.01
amplitude cutoff < 0.01
presence ratio >= 0.99
nearest-neighbors hit rate > 0.96
SNR > 3.0
```

Each unit was then manually inspected to confirm its quality.

There were a total of 76 high-quality units across both datasets.
