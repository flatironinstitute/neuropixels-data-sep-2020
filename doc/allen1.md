## Data from Josh Siegle (Allen Institute)

Units were selected based on the following criteria:
```
ISI violations < 0.01
amplitude cutoff < 0.01
presence ratio >= 0.99
nearest-neighbors hit rate > 0.96
SNR > 3.0
```

Each unit was then manually inspected to confirm its quality.

There were a total of 76 high-quality units across both datasets.

See the [main README document](../README.md) for information on accessing these data.
