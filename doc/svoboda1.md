## Data from Susu Chen (Karel Svoboda Lab)

A Phase 3B Neuropixels probe was inserted 2.9 mm into secondary motor cortex of an awake, head-fixed mouse performing a trial-based behavioural task. 

Overall 302 channels were recorded using open source software SpikeGLX. The number of usable channels is 299.

After global demuxing and concatenation of trial-based recording into a continuous one using CatGT, the recording was spike-sorted automatically by Kilosort2 and manually curated in JRCLUST GUI. In total, 201 single units were identified.
