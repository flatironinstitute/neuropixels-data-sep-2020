### Curation criteria for the below recordings

snr>6, isi violation < 0.5% or < 5 counts, isolation distance > 100

### svoboda-SC026_080619_g0_tcat_imec0

A Phase 3B Neuropixels probe was inserted 2.9 mm into secondary motor cortex of an awake, head-fixed mouse performing a trial-based behavioural task. 

Overall 302 channels were recorded using open source software SpikeGLX. The number of usable channels is 299.

After global demuxing and concatenation of trial-based recording into a continuous one using CatGT, the recording was spike-sorted automatically by Kilosort2 and manually curated in JRCLUST GUI. In total, 201 single units were identified.

### svoboda-SC022_030319_g0_tcat_imec2

A Phase 3B Neuropixels probe was inserted 4.5 mm into left hemisphere striatum of an awake, head-fixed mouse performing a trial-based behavioural task. 

Overall 385 channels were recorded using open source software SpikeGLX.

After global demuxing and concatenation of trial-based recording into a continuous file using CatGT, the recording was spike-sorted automatically by Kilosort2 and manually curated in JRCLUST GUI. In total, 119 single units were identified.

### svoboda-SC026_080619_g0_tcat_imec2

A Phase 3B Neuropixels probe was inserted 4.7 mm into the left hemisphere hippocampus&thalamus of an awake, head-fixed mouse performing a trial-based behavioural task. 

Overall 385 channels were recorded using open source software SpikeGLX.

After global demuxing and concatenation of trial-based recordings into a continuous file using CatGT, the data was spike-sorted automatically by Kilosort2 and manually curated in JRCLUST GUI. In total, 119 single units were identified. 

### svoboda-SC035_011020_g0_tcat_imec0

A 2.0 4-shank Neuropixels probe was inserted 1 mm into the right hemisphere secondary motor cortex of an awake, head-fixed mouse performing a trial-based behavioural task. 

Overall 385 channels were recorded using open source software SpikeGLX.

A 'horizontal stripe' across all shanks in the bottom of bank0 was recorded, i.e. each shank with 96 channels.

After global demuxing and concatenation of trial-based recordings into a continuous file using CatGT, the recording was spike-sorted automatically by Kilosort2 and manually curated in JRCLUST GUI. In total, 93 single units were identified.

### svoboda-SC035_010920_g0_tcat_imec1

A 2.0 4-shank Neuropixels probe was inserted 4.75 mm into the left hemisphere medulla of an awake, head-fixed mouse performing a trial-based behavioural task. 

Overall 385 channels were recorded using open source software SpikeGLX.

A 'horizontal stripe' across all shanks in the bottom of bank0 was recorded, i.e. each shank with 96 channels.

After global demuxing and concatenation of trial-based recordings into a continuous file using CatGT, the recording was spike-sorted automatically by Kilosort2 and manually curated in JRCLUST GUI. In total, 70 single units were identified.

Due to the prevalence of dense firing and high amplitude units in the medulla, a different set of criteria was used for manual curation. For instance, a refractory period of 1 ms and amplitude > 100 uV were used, instead of 2 ms refractory and SNR > 6.
